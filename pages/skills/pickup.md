# Pickup

With this skill your pet can pickup items \(and XP\) like a player that lie on the ground. The items are added to the [backpack](https://github.com/xXKeyleXx/MyPet-Wiki/tree/07680434e1278c970819d5e9518888598106688b/pages/skills/skills/backpack/README.md) of the pet. This skill can not be activated when the pet doesn't has the Backpack skill with at least 1 row.

Pickup can be enabled/disabled by using /petpickup [command](https://github.com/xXKeyleXx/MyPet-Wiki/tree/07680434e1278c970819d5e9518888598106688b/pages/skills/commands/README.md).
