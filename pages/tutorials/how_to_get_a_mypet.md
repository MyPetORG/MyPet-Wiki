# How to get a pet

There are three simple steps on your way to get a pet.

----

## Step 1 - Find the mob you want

Find a mob that is tameable is the easiest step. All tamable mobtypes can be found [here](mobtypes) (This may vary for your server as each type can be enabled/disabled with permissions).

## Step 2 - Meeting the Requirements

This can be the hardest part but how hard it really will depends on the configuration of the Server.
Every pet-Type has a [setting](/petconfig) called [LeashFlags](/leashflag) that sets the requirements needed for the pet-Type to become a pet.

## Step 3 - Taking mob on a lead

When Step 1 & 2 are done you just have to hit you target with the LeashItem (String by default).
After hiting your target it will convert from a normal mob into a pet and you will see a message like this:
<font color="green">You took a pet on a lead, it will be a good pet.</font>
