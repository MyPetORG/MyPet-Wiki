# Important Notes

There is only **one** important thing that needs particular attention. Every single _MyPet_-version is **only** compatible with the specified **Minecraft**-versions! _MyPet_ will not load if you try to run it with other **Minecraft**-versions. The Bukkit/Spigot-Version \(mostly\) doesn't matter as long as the **Minecraft** version is compatible.
