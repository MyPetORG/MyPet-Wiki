# How to get a pet

There are three simple steps on your way to get a pet.

## Step 1 - Finding a leadable Mob

Find a mob that is leadable is the easiest step. All leadable mobtypes can be found [here](mobtypes).

## Step 2 - Meeting the Requirements

This can be the hardest part but how hard it really will depends on the configuration of the Server.<br>
Every pet-Type has a [setting](petconfig) called [LeashFlags](leashflag) that sets the requirements needed for the pet-Type to become a pet.

## Step 3 - Taking mob on a lead

When Step 1 & 2 are done you just have to hit you target with the LeashItem (String by default).
After hiting your target it will convert from a normal mob into a pet and you will see a message like this:
<font color="green">You took a pet on a lead, it will be a good pet.</font>

Congratulation you now have a pet.
