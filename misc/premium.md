# MyPet-Premium

MyPet-Premium was the paid version of [MyPet](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mypet.12725/) that the author of MyPet offers on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/). It had additional features but was since been discontinued. All features have been added to the free version of MyPet. 

## Particle effects

If you purchased the premium version of the plugin you can still [select](https://mypet-plugin.de/premium/particles) up to 2 Minecraft usernames \(UUIDs\) who will then get particle effects on their pets!
