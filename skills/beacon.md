# Beacon

The Beacon skill transforms your pet in a walking and more powerfull [beacon](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Beacon_Block). For administration of the buffs the plugin uses a custom menu \(see Beacon Buff Selection Menu\) that can be opened with the `/petbeacon` [command](../setup/commands.md#skill-commands). By default this skill consumes food when it is active, that means the [Saturation](../systems/hungersystem.md)-Value decreases continuously while the skill is active.
