# How to get a MyPet

There are three simple steps on your way to get a *MyPet*.

## Step 1 - Finding a leadable Mob

Find a mob that is leadable is the easiest step. All leadable mobtypes can be found [here](en/mobtypes).

## Step 2 - Meeting the Requirements

This can be the hardest part but how hard it really will depends on the configuration of the Server.\\
Every MyPet-Type has a [setting](en/petconfig) called [LeashFlags](en/leashflag) that sets the requirements needed for the MyPet-Type to become a pet.

## Step 3 - Taking mob on a lead

When Step 1 & 2 are done you just have to hit you target with the LeashItem (String by default).
After hiting your target it will convert from a normal mob into a *MyPet* and you will see a message like this:
`<color green>`You took a pet on a lead, it will be a good MyPet.`</color>`

Congratulation you now have a *MyPet*.
