# How to get a pet

## Step 1 - Find the mob you want

Find a mob that is tameable is the easiest step. All mobtypes are tamable except Shulkers because they can't move.

## Step 2 - Meeting the Requirements

This can be the hardest part but how hard it really will depends on the configuration of the Server. Every pet-Type has a [setting](../setup/configurations/pet-config.yml.md) called [LeashFlags](../systems/leashflag.md) that sets the requirements needed for the pet-Type to become a pet.

## Step 3 - Taking mob on a lead

When Step 1 & 2 are done you just have to hit \(attack\) your target with the LeashItem \(`Lead` by default\). After hitting your target it will convert from a normal mob into a pet and you will see a message like this:

You took a pet on a lead, it will be a good pet.

{% hint style="info" %}
Using the Lead as a weapon is required to perform the actual act of taming.  
Putting the mob on the lead/rope will do nothing towards taming your new pet.
{% endhint %}
