# How to get a pet

## Step 1 - Find the mob you want

Find a mob that is tameable is the easiest step. All mobtypes are tamable except Shulkers because they can't move.

## Step 2 - Meeting the Requirements

This can be the hardest part but how hard it really will depends on the configuration of the Server. Every pet-Type has a [setting](https://github.com/xXKeyleXx/MyPet-Wiki/tree/07680434e1278c970819d5e9518888598106688b/petconfig/README.md) called [LeashFlags](https://github.com/xXKeyleXx/MyPet-Wiki/tree/07680434e1278c970819d5e9518888598106688b/leashflag/README.md) that sets the requirements needed for the pet-Type to become a pet.

## Step 3 - Taking mob on a lead

When Step 1 & 2 are done you just have to hit you target with the LeashItem \(String by default\). After hiting your target it will convert from a normal mob into a pet and you will see a message like this:

You took a pet on a lead, it will be a good pet.
