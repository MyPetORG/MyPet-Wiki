# Auto Updater

## Enable the Auto Updater

By default the plugin checks for plugin updates but doesn't download them. You can enable the download by activating it in the config \(_`MyPet.Update.Download`_\)

ðŸ’² Premium users have to set a download token in the config \(_`MyPet.Update.Token`_\) that authenticates the download. The token can be found on the [download page](https://mypet-plugin.de/download) of the MyPet website. _\(login & an activated premium key required\)_ ðŸ’²
