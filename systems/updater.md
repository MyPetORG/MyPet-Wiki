# Auto Updater

## Step 1 - Install the Auto Updater

Since MyPet 2.3.0 \(Premium: 2.3.5 or D1\) the auto updater is part of the plugin.

## Step 2 - Enable the Auto Updater

By default the plugin checks for plugin updates but doesn't download them. You can enable the download by activating it in the config \(_MyPet.Update.Download_\)

![$](../.gitbook/assets/premium.gif) Premium users have to set a download token in the config \(_MyPet.Update.Token_\) that authenticates the download. The token can be found on the [download page](https://mypet-plugin.de/download) of the MyPet website. _\(login & an activated premium key required\)_ ![$](../.gitbook/assets/premium.gif)

## Step 3 - Reload the plugin

Just reload/restart the server and the plugin will automatically check for updates and download it if there is one.
